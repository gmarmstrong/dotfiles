# new-mac

Post-installation script for new Apple computers. Note that these scripts are
very personal to how I use my own computers. You'll likely want to roll your
own rather than fork mine.

## Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gmarmstrong/new-mac # Clone this repository
./new-mac/newmac-1.sh # Run the first script
./new-mac/newmac-2.sh # Run the second script
```
