# Introduction

This is my dotfiles repository. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My dotfiles repository is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my dotfiles repository is useless. Without my dotfiles repository, I am useless.

# Description

* The `bcrc` file adds a little bit of Ï€ to [`bc`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bc_(programming_language)), the arbitrary-precision calculator language. The file is invoked through an alias in `~/.zshrc`.
* The `gitconfig` file gets and sets my global [git options](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html). Roll your own, because you (hopefully!) won't get much use out of mine.
* The `hushlogin` file hides [login messages](https://linux.die.net/man/1/login) from appearing whenever a new terminal session is started.
* The `ideavimrc` file is a simplified Vim configuration for the IntelliJ IDE plugin [IdeaVim](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim).
* The `inputrc` file sets shell editing to vi mode.
* The `vimrc` file holds my Vim configuration.
* The `zshrc` file sets more environment variables and aliases.
